# Hacking your linkedin profile

This is just a short article on how to squeeze the most responses out of your linkedin profile. It's not a magic recipe, but it definitle helps to better understand the platform and how to sell yourself to recruiters.


## The mentality

You are selling a product (yourself). Make yourself intresting. Choose a nice profile picture, talk about hobbies or intrests, without going too much into details. Also, good chalenge: keep it corporate friendly and mature. Best way to not sound naive and imature: don,t say anything. Keep it to the essential

You want to sell it to recruiters, not your peers. Recruiters don't always make the best decision. Not because they are dumb, but because they have not time to waste. They send dozens of messages and requests at a time and their tech knowledge is often limited. (example: requiring 10 years exp in node or trying to recruit one of the founders of a programming language and asking for his credentials in the matter)


## First, the title

What do you want to do? "Don't dress for the job you have, dress for the job you want" is not just a cheesy saying. If you've started learning a language and want to work professionaly with that language because it's your new passion; put it up and high on your profile.

Your title is what recruiters click the most on, when manually screening. It should be not too long but informative enough. Prefer stuff like "XXX Developer" or "XXX Programer".

Using buzzwords: it's an advanced technique. Don't do it unless you really, REALLY know what you're doing.
Funny anecdote: I once refered to myself as a Node.js Grand wizard, only later to find out that it was a title used by a not so commandable organization whose name is three letters rhyming with Mickey.

Second the profile picture. Make yourself presentable, clean but mostly `fun to be serious with`.

## Third The bio

Don't spend too much time in there, it's filler- really. Just a small text about what you do and what motivates you.
The important bit is the list of technologies you'll drop in there. Just make a comma-separated list of things you know or intrest you, formatting is not too important, this is mostly for bots.

## Fourth the work exp

You'll have to make the tough decision of wiping every non-related experience you have in there- unless it's trully character defining (ex: military service) or it's an industry in which you spent a lot of time (carreer change).

Once that is done, make sure you get some detail in there, what were your tasks, your challenges, your accomplishments.


## Fifth recommandations and skill endorsements

Right now, start adding the people around you and endorsing each other. It's a numbers game, the content is of low relevance to recruiters.

## Sixth and final the human factor

Fill the other sections like circles of intrest, groups, teams, involvement. This is the human factor. Once you've made it through the first passes of screening, this part is just the icing- the 'oh wow, this person trully goes above and beyond'


## Behaving on LinkedIn

- Adding recruiters as friends: only if you know them personnaly, me them in person
- Commenting on posts and messaging groups or people: yes. Online presence is good
- Finally: good general internets advice: keep your facebook and your email professionnal looking, yes- recruiters check that.
